Each noisemaker will also require:

2x M2 screws, long enough to reach through your board material 
2x M2 nuts

I used 1/8 inch acrylic for the boards. Any reasonably stiff material will work (I'd like to see an implication cut from card stock and 'drilled' with a hole punch). I found that transparent colors of acrylic
work *much* better than opaque - being able to see the board art from both sides is very useful.
