Noise-O-Tron
==========

A small, cheap optical theremin that can be assembled with no soldering.

The idea is to laser cut a custom perfboard from acrylic, heavy cardstock or other suitable material.
Components are pushed through the top of this perfboard and the leads are twisted together to form a circuit.

In the root of this project there are two PDF files - ten_boards.pdf and thirty_boards.pdf - these are exported from inkscape with vector lines 0.001" in width. I use these files on an Epilog machine - you may need to generate your own for other print driver-based machines.
